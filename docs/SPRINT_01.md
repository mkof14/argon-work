# Sprint 01 Plan

## Goal
Deliver a functional vertical slice: onboarding -> course access -> checkout stub -> dashboard.

## Backlog
1. Auth endpoints with JWT issuance and refresh
2. User + org schema and migrations
3. Course catalog CRUD and lesson progress tracking
4. Checkout flow integration with Stripe test mode
5. Dashboard widgets consuming real API data
6. CI pipeline for lint/test/build

## Definition of done
- Critical endpoints documented and tested
- Role-based route protection on web
- Payment sandbox flow completed end-to-end
